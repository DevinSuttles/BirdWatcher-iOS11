# Bird Watcher
Bird Watcher is an iOS app that helps you learn about birds you come across outside. After finding a bird, take a picture of it and the app will identify the bird's species, giving you information about it and even its bird call!

# How does it work?
Bird Watcher uses a convolutional neural network trained using apples create ml model library a model I created qtih 15 species of bird using 500 images from google image search. The model is integrated with the iPhone so when images are captured it outputs the name of the species.

# Who is it for?
Anyone wanting to get outside and learn about nature and birds should use this app!

# Where can I get it?
Bird Watcher will be coming to a local app store near you.
