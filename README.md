# Bird Watcher
Bird Watcher is an iOS app that helps you learn about birds you come across outside. After finding a bird, take a picture of it and the app will identify the bird's species, giving you information about it!

# How does it work?
Bird Watcher uses a convolutional neural network trained using the Keras machine learning library on 13 species of birds with 160 pictures in trainin data set and 40 pictures in the testing data set. The model was converted for the CoreML Swift library and integrated with the iPhone camera so that when pictures are taken it will recgonize the species in real time resulting in a prediction.

# Who is it for?
Anyone wanting to get outside and learn about nature and birds should use this app!

# Where can I get it?
Bird Watcher is avalable on the app store (iOS Only)
